# Autonomous-Lane-Keeping-and-Adaptive-Cruise-control-on-RC-car
Drive an RC vehicle based on ultrasonic sensors to achieve Adaptive Cruise Control(ACC) and Autonomous Lane Keeping
Kalman filter is used to get accurate positions using ultrasonic sensor
Front facing sensor is used to maintain 30cm distance from obstacle
Side sensors are used for Autonomous Lane Keeping
